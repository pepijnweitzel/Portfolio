Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:

With the number of simulations multiplying by 10, the real time however did not multiply by 10.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:

The predictions seemed to stabilize after 10000 simulations.
