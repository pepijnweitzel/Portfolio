# CarShare
#### Video Demo:  <URL HERE>
#### Description:
CarShare is a web-based application using JavaScript, Python and Sqlite3. I walk you slowly through it by starting off with the html pages.

### HTML:
starting of with layout.html you'll find the layout I used for all my html pages. There is a distinction between the login and register page and the other pages since you're not meant to acces some things from the login and register page. It shows how I used Bootstrap's navbar with some edits and changes made to it. The login page shows 2 input containers and a submit button, below that it is joined by a carousel of 3 pictures, swiping automatically through Bootstrap's help. The register page is quiet similar to the login page but contains a couple more input containers, also it contains some JavaScript to show and hide text explaining the joining/creating group process.
