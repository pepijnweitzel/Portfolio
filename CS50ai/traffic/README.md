### Experimental process:
I started off with just an input layer, a convolutional layer, a pooling layer and an output layer. I noticed the program was already giving back decent results, with an accuracy around 94%. after changing the pooling from 3,3 to 2,2 I noticed that the accuracy on the training part increased slightly, but on the testing part decreased slightly. after adding the first hidden layer. I noticed the accuracy in the first couple epoch was drastically lower but increasing after those and getting to an accuracy of around 97% on the training part, and an accuracy of 95% on the testing part. Then I added a dropout of 50%, I noticed that the accuracy on the training part slightly decreased, however the accuracy of the test part slightly increased, which shows a small result of overfitting. After adding a second, third and fourth hidden layer I noticed not much difference, but when decreasing the dropout after that, the accuracy on the training part increased while decreasing on the testing part, again showing the result of overfitting. In the end I came to the conclusion 2 hidden layers with a dropout of 50% gave the best accuracy.
