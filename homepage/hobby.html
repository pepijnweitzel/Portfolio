        <hr>
        <p>
            I'm Pepijn Weitzel and at the age of 19 I found my true passion in the world of programming and since then, there's been no looking back. My room is my sanctuary, a cluttered desk with screens,<br>
            cables, and the ever-present aroma of coffee. Countless hours are spent pouring over lines of code, debugging, and crafting elegant solutions to complex problems. For me, programming isn't just a hobby; it's a way of life.<br>
            But I'm more than just a programmer. In my community, I'm known as someone who's always willing to lend a helping hand. Despite my deep immersion in the digital realm, I make it a point to assist friends,<br>
            family, and even strangers with their tech-related challenges. Whether it's fixing a neighbor's computer, helping a friend with a troublesome app, or explaining programming concepts to newcomers,<br>
            I'm always ready to help. I aspire to get more involved in the business, with the goal of achieving just that. Using my knowledge of programming, I plan to start building websites for local businesses,<br>
            creating apps to assist people with disabilities, and volunteering to teach coding to kids at a nearby community center.
            As the seasons changed in the Netherlands, I continued to grow as a programmer and as a person. My helpfulness, honed in the hospitality industry, now finds expression in the digital world, where I use my skills to make life a little bit better for those around me.
