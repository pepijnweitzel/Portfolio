            In the charming town of Reek, I, a 19-year-old named Pepijn Weitzel am making waves in the world of programming. His journey began with the CS50 Introduction to Computer Science course, and he hasn't looked back since. Pepijn's room is a haven of screens, cables, and the scent of fresh coffee, where he spends countless hours crafting elegant code solutions.
            But Pepijn is more than just a programmer. Known for his helpful nature, he dedicates time to assist friends, family, and even strangers with their tech-related challenges. Whether it's fixing a computer glitch or explaining programming concepts, Pepijn is always ready to lend a hand.
            Previously, Pepijn enjoyed a career in the hospitality industry, which he loved deeply. However, life threw a curveball his way when he was diagnosed with a thumb condition, forcing him to leave that behind. Instead of dwelling on limitations, he embraced coding as a way to give back. Pepijn builds websites for local businesses, creates apps to help those with disabilities, and volunteers to teach coding to kids in his community.
            Pepijn Weitzel's story is one of resilience and the power of using one's skills to make a positive impact. Join him on his coding journey and discover the heart of gold behind the code.
