        <h1 id="h1">Meet me, a Dutch explorer</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>
          Hello there! My name is Pepijn Weitzel, and I'm thrilled to share a bit about myself with you. I believe life is a grand adventure, and I'm always on the lookout for new experiences and knowledge. <br>
          Here's a glimpse into my story: <br><br>
          I hail from the beautiful Netherlands, where I embarked on the challenging TTO VWO program during high school. This rigorous educational journey fueled my passion<br>
          for learning and broadened my horizons. It's amazing how much you can discover when you're encouraged to explore. After completing high school, I decided to take a giant leap into the unknown.<br>
          My girlfriend and I embarked on an incredible 11-month world trip. We roamed through bustling cities, trekked in serene mountains, and soaked up the cultures of diverse countries. <br>
          This journey shaped me in ways I could have never imagined, fostering my curiosity and a deep appreciation for the beauty of our planet. As an eternal seeker of knowledge, <br>
          I'm currently diving into the world of computer science through Harvard's CS50 Introduction to Computer Science course. The digital realm offers endless possibilities, and I can't wait to explore<br>
          the depths of coding and technology. I came into this world on the 8th of June in 2004, and since then, every birthday has been a reminder of the wonderful adventure called life. <br>
          I'm always eager to celebrate another year of growth, learning, and discovery. Curiosity is my driving force. I believe that the pursuit of knowledge, understanding, and experience is what makes life truly fulfilling. <br>
          Whether it's delving into the mysteries of the universe, learning a new language, or exploring a hidden gem in my own backyard, I'm always ready to embrace the next adventure.<br><br>
          So, that's a little about me, a Dutch explorer with a passion for learning, a love for travel, and an insatiable curiosity about the world and the endless possibilities it holds. <br>
          I'm excited to connect, learn, and share experiences with you as we navigate this exciting journey called life together.
