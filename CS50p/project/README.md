#### Description:
CarGameReek is a game created in PyGame to help kill the time, earn points by dodging the obstacles on the road!

### Setup
I've set up 3 globals which are used during my program: running, lost and score. Running takes care of the loop in which my game is playing, if at any point it is set to False, the game will stop. Lost will determine whether the user quit the game or lost, if lost is set to True, it will show the score obtained in the terminal. The last global variable is score
